# Dashboard Insights

The dashboard provides three key insights:

1 Weekly Revenue Trends

   * Electronics dominate sales, especially on Saturdays and Mondays.
   * Clothing shows steady revenue throughout the week, acting as a stabilizer.
   * Beauty underperforms but shows potential on Fridays and Mondays.

2. Year-on-Year Growth

   *Electronics has the strongest growth rate (close to 100%).
   *Clothing also shows significant growth.
   *Beauty grows more slowly but from a smaller base.

3. Total Revenue by Category

   * Electronics and Clothing contribute the highest total revenue (\~R155,000 each).
   * Beauty lags behind at around R140,000.

# Business Recommendations

* Electronics → Invest in marketing and stock availability before weekends; bundle promotions with other categories.

* Beauty → Targeted promotions on Fridays and Mondays, leverage influencer marketing, and cross-sell with Clothing/Electronics.
